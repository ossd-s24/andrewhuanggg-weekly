title: Week 14 - Open Source Outside of Software

## Open Source Discussion

For the class discussion, I chose to talk about open source in the hardware industry. The idea of 'open source' in hardware applies to a very broad scope of objects, and usually involves sharing schematics, blueprints, and other related design files, which can allow users to modify and redistribute the hardware related to it. In terms of computer science, two popular examples of open source hardware is Arduino and Rasberry Pi. Moreover, I found it interesting that some of the open source examples that my peers presented on fit under the umbrella of 'open source hardware'. For example, Precious Plastic and OpenMotors both involve the use of open source hardware.

Based on our class discussion, I came to the conclusion that open source principles can be applied to virtually every industry. One common benefit of using open source in any industry is that it improves accessibility in some manner, as seen in all the different examples that my peers chose. 

 
# Group Progress
Currently, we are still working on the same three GitHub issues that we have been working on for the past few weeks. We have requested changes on our pull requests that we need to fix, and hopefully we can get a pull request merged.
