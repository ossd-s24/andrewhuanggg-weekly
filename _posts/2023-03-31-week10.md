title: Week 10 - Continuing Work on OpenFoodFacts


---


## Progress

After getting my pull request for rewriting their setup instructions merged into the repository, I helped with an issue that my groupmate claimed about creating a custom SCSS file for Tagify inputs. More specifically, I assisted in the process of debugging how the dropdown items in some of their text inputs are styled. In the mean time, we are trying to find more issues to claim, and we are going to reach out to the project maintainer directly in order to do so. <!--more-->In addition, I am continuing to translate more documentation in Chinese, in order to increase accessibility. One challenge I have faced in the translation process is translating technical terms from English to Chinese, as I normally don't talk about very technical matters when I am speaking to someone in Chinese. Finally, I am starting to scan products into the Open Food Facts app, in order to help their main mission of providing food transparency to everyone around the world.
