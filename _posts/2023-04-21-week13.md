title: Week 13 - Cathedral vs Bazaar

## Cathedral and the Bazaar

My choice of favorite lesson from The Cathedral and the Bazaar is "Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers." Even though my peers had great reasons for picking other lessons as their favorite, my favorite lesson still stays the same. My reasoning behind this is that the quote I chose is very applicable advice to the real world, and I've often seen success attached to following this principle. Many companies have found success with constantly releasing updates for their software/apps, and prioritizing working on user needs based on user feedback. In my opinion, there isn't much downside to releasing early and often, as it speeds up progress on the developer roadmap.

## Open Source Progress

Right now, my group is working together to tackle three different issues. We have made pull requests for two of the issues, but we are going back and forth with the maintainers on GitHub and Slack to resolve all the requested changes for our initial pull requests. Therefore, the primary challenge as a group is to get pull requests merged for all these issues. Moreover, the main challenge for me is understanding certain parts of the Perl syntax, and debugging.
